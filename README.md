<h1>GOALS of Alpha-Beta Pruning in MiniMax Search Algorithm</h1>

<h3>Improve the decision-making efficiency of the computer player by reducing the number of evaluated nodes in the game tree.</h3>
<h3>Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation incorporating the Alpha-Beta pruning and the Minimax algorithm with Python Code.</h3>
<h1>IMPLEMENTATION</h1>

The project involves developing a Tic-Tac-Toe game implementation incorporating the Alpha-Beta pruning with the Minimax algorithm. Using this algorithm, the computer player analyzes the game state, evaluates possible moves, and selects the optimal action based on the anticipated outcomes.

<h1>The Minimax algorithm</h1>

recursively evaluates all possible moves and their potential outcomes, creating a game tree.

<h1>Alpha-Beta pruning</h1>

Alpha‚ÄìBeta (ùõº‚àíùõΩ) algorithm is actually an improved minimax using a heuristic. It stops evaluating a move when it makes sure that it‚Äôs worse than a previously examined move. Such moves need not to be evaluated further.

When added to a simple minimax algorithm, it gives the same output but cuts off certain branches that can‚Äôt possibly affect the final decision ‚Äî dramatically improving the performance

## PROGRAM
```python
import tkinter as tk


for b in self.buttons:
b.config(state=tk.DISABLED)


def reset(self):
self.board = [""] * 9
self.game_over = False
self.status_label.config(text="Your turn (X)")
for b in self.buttons:
b.config(text="", state=tk.NORMAL)




# Game logic
WIN_COMBINATIONS = [
(0, 1, 2), (3, 4, 5), (6, 7, 8),
(0, 3, 6), (1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8),
(0, 4, 8), (2, 4, 6)
]


def check_winner(board):
for a, b, c in WIN_COMBINATIONS:
if board[a] and board[a] == board[b] == board[c]:
return board[a]
return None


def is_board_full(board):
return all(cell != "" for cell in board)




def minimax(board, depth, is_maximizing, alpha, beta):
winner = check_winner(board)
if winner == AI:
return 10 - depth
elif winner == HUMAN:
return depth - 10
elif is_board_full(board):
return 0


if is_maximizing:
max_eval = -999
for i in range(9):
if board[i] == "":
board[i] = AI
eval = minimax(board, depth + 1, False, alpha, beta)
board[i] = ""
max_eval = max(max_eval, eval)
alpha = max(alpha, eval)
if beta <= alpha:
break
return max_eval
else:
min_eval = 999
for i in range(9):
if board[i] == "":
board[i] = HUMAN
eval = minimax(board, depth + 1, True, alpha, beta)
board[i] = ""
min_eval = min(min_eval, eval)
beta = min(beta, eval)
if beta <= alpha:
break
return min_eval




def best_move(board):
best_score = -999
move = None
for i in range(9):
if board[i] == "":
board[i] = AI
score = minimax(board, 0, False, -999, 999)
board[i] = ""
if score > best_score:
best_score = score
move = i
return move
